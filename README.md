# BlackLock

A task management app that actually makes you complete your tasks.

## Why BlackLock?

Most task management apps make the same critical mistake: they let users mark tasks as complete without actually doing them. It's too easy to lie to yourself with a simple checkbox.

BlackLock solves this problem by requiring **multiple confirmations** before marking a task as complete. This deliberate friction makes you pause and think: *"Maybe I should actually complete this task in reality?"*

Instead of enabling self-deception, BlackLock encourages genuine productivity through:
- Double confirmation system with motivational quotes
- Optional PIN protection for task completion

## What is BlackLock?

BlackLock transforms your daily tasks into a personal character development journey. Complete tasks to earn experience points, level up your character, and progress through ranks from Novice to Legend.

The app uses game mechanics to make productivity engaging while maintaining integrity through its anti-cheating design.
